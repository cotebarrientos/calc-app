**Calc-app** is my first project using React JS, and as the name says, it emulates a calculator that is able to do basic mathematical operations including the following:

- Add (+)
- Subtract (-)
- Multiply (*)
- Divide (/)

This project is part of the exercises performed in my specialization course about React JS and Redux on <a href='https://www.udemy.com/course/react-js-redux-es6-completo-de-0-a-experto-espanol/' target='_blank'>Udemy</a>.
